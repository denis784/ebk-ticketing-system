## Project Overview

The EBK Ticketing System consists of a frontend built using React and a backend built with Node.js and MongoDB as the database. Users can register with the system, log in, and access various ticketing services.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, Material-UI, and styled-components. It provides a user-friendly interface for registration and login.

- **Backend (Node.js)**: The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles user registration, login, and provides RESTful API endpoints for ticketing services.

- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information and ticketing data.

## Installation

To run the EBK Ticketing System on your local machine, follow these installation steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- MongoDB: Install MongoDB and make sure it's running.

### Frontend Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/denis784/ebk-ticketing-system.git
cd Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend
npm start

Backend (Node.js) Installation

# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/denis784/ebk-ticketing-system.git
cd Backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend
node server.js


Usage
Frontend
Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Register a new user or log in if you already have an account.
Backend (Node.js)
The backend (Node.js) provides API endpoints for user registration and login. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API. The API is available at http://localhost:4000.

API Documentation
Detailed API documentation can be found in the API.md file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
